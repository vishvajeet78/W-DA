        Creating DOM 
    </h2>
<p>
    In an HTML document, the document.createElement() is a method used to create the HTML element. The element specified using elementName is created or an unknown HTML element is created if the specified elementName is not recognized.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><br>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
 <br>
 <br>

    DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a tree-like structure composed of objects. 
    <br>
    

    The Document Object Model (DOM) is essential in web development for several reasons:
    <br><br>

    1.DYNAMIC WEB PAGES :  With the DOM, you can respond to user actions (like clicks, inputs, or scrolls) and modify the web page accordingly.
     Content Updates: When you want to update the content without refreshing the entire page, the DOM enables targeted changes making the web applications more efficient and user-friendly.
     <br>

    2.CROSS BROWSER- COMPATIBILITY: Different browsers may render HTML and CSS in different ways. The DOM provides a standardized way to interact with page elements.
    <br>
    3. Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Applications built with frameworks such as React or Angular, heavily rely on the DOM for efficient rendering and updating of content within a single HTML page without reloading the full page.
    <br>
    <br>

<h2>
    DOCTYPE 
</h2>
<p>
    The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<h2>
    Character Encoding 
</h2>
<p> 
    Character encoding tells computers how to interpret digital data into letters, numbers and symbols. This is done by assigning a specific numeric value to a letter, number or symbol. These letters, numbers, and symbols are classified as â€œcharacters.
    <br>
